### Search an element in an array

Sure! Letâ€™s break down the simplified code step by step:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

This includes the necessary header file for input/output operations and brings standard names into scope.

---

```cpp
int main() {
    int N, X;
    cin >> N >> X;
```

* `N` is the number of elements in the array.
* `X` is the element we are searching for.
* We read both from standard input.

---

```cpp
    while (N--) {
        int a;
        cin >> a;
```

* `while (N--)` means: loop N times (decreasing N each time).
* `a` is a temporary variable used to store each input number one at a time.

---

```cpp
        if (a == X) {
            cout << "YES" << endl;
            return 0;
        }
```

* If the current number `a` matches `X`, we print `"YES"` and immediately exit the program (`return 0;`).

---

```cpp
    }

    cout << "NO" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

* If the loop finishes without finding `X`, we print `"NO"` and exit.

This version avoids storing the entire array and exits early once the element is found, making it both simpler and faster.
